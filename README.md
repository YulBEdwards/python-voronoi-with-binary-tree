# Python version of Fortune's Voronoi algorithm with AVL self-balancing binary tree

This project is a modification of Janson Hendryli’s python translation of Matt Brubeck’s C++ implementation of Stephen Fortune’s plane sweep Voronoi generation algorithm. The algorithm is usually described as a constantly changing beach front as a sweep line crosses the generating points. Many readers of Fortune’s C implementation found it lacked clarity, to say the least. This project is an attempt to show the Fortune algorithm in simpler terms.

See demo description for more information.
